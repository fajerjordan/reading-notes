# JavaScript layers

## Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Where possible, aim to keep the three languages in separate files, with the HTML page linking to CSS and JavaScript files.
Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose. Each layer, from left to right. builds on the previous one.
HTML layer. This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.

#CSS layer
The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).

#Javascript layer
## This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interact ivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.

## Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript. You can also reuse the code on severa l pages (making the site faster to load and easier to maintain).
