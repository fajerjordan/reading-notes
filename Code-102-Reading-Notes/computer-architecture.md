## Everywhere you look, computers are changing the world. But while most of us use this revolutionary technology daily, we don't often ask: **"How do computers work?"**

# So, as  the pioneers of computer science explored how to design a thinking machine, they realized that it had to perform four different tasks.

## It would need to take input, store information process it and then output the results.  

## That's what makes a computer a computer.

## Across all computers, regardless of the different types of technology they use, they're always doing those same four things.



# You'll hear that everything's "1s and 0s" in a computer, but what does that mean? 

## Find out how computers represent numbers, words, images, and sound.

## Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data. A binary digit, or bit, is the smallest unit of data in computing. It is represented by a 0 or a 1. 
## Binary numbers are made up of binary digits (bits), eg the binary number 1001.

## The circuits in a computer's processor are made up of billions of transistors. A transistor is a tiny switch that is activated by the electronic signals it receives. 
## The digits 1 and 0 used in binary reflect the on and off states of a transistor.

## Computers often chain logic gates together, by taking the output from one gate and using it as the input to another gate. We call that a logic circuit.
Circuits enables computers to do more complex operations than they could accomplish with just a single gate.

#CPU, Memory, Input & Output
## Computers require input hardware, processing hardware and output hardware. The hardware that defines a computer is the CPU and memory. Without these a computer could not function.
 ## Memory - stores program operations and data while a program is being executed. There are several types of memory, including: registers, cache, RAM and virtual memory.
