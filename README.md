![Growth Mindset](https://3kllhk1ibq34qk6sp3bhtox1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/growth-mindset.png)
## A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

## By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

> ## Here’s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:

##  We can pull ourselves back into growth-iness and ultimately be more successful, throght ` Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset ` , like: 

### 1. Challenges :facepunch:

### 2. Obstacles :man_facepalming:

### 3. Effort :muscle:

### 4. Criticism :thumbsdown:

### 5. Success of others :handshake:

## Personally, i would to share 3 reminders to myself of *how to keep myself in a growth mindset*:
- [x] When i'm not good at doing this , i try it again and again until i do it perfectly :+1:
- [x] I don't give up never :v:
- [x] Maybe this is too hard, but not impossible :skull_and_crossbones:

## Finally, i would to say: ~~grow not just at work~~ , grow at work and outside work too.
